# --------------    iterator vs iterable    --------------

# these are related to loops

# Objectives: 
    # part 1: ITEARTORS
        # Difference between ITERATOR and ITERABLE
            # Define Iterator and Iterable 

        # User defined ITERATOR
            # Understand the iter() and next() methods

        # How make our CLASS ITERABLE

        # Detail on how loops work
            # Build our own for loop


    # part 2: GENERATORS
        # Define what generators are and how they can be used 
            # How GENERATORS are related to iterators

        # Compare 'generator FUNCTIONS' and 'generator EXPRESSION's 
        # Use generators to PAUSE execution of expensive functions
