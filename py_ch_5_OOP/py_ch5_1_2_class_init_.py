# ------------------    class definition    ------------------
# Convention: Always use "CamelCase" first letter in uppercase
# use snake_case for "variables" and "functions"

class Person:
	pass    # Empty class are not valid in python, so we used "pass"

p = Person()    # use () to create an 'Instance' of a class
print(type(p))
print(p)




# Example 1: Define a class called Vehicle.  It should be completely empty (just add a pass statement inside) . 
                # After the class is defined, create two instances of Vehicle.  
                    # Save one to a variable called car  
                    # Save another to a variable called boat.

class Vehicle:
    pass

car = Vehicle()
boat = Vehicle()
