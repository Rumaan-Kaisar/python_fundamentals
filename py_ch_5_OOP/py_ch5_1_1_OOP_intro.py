# Objectives:
    # Define OOP
    # Understand ENCAPSULATION & POLYMORPHISM
    # Create CLASS & INSTANCES and attach methods and properties to them


# ------------    OOP    ------------    
    # OOP is a method to model some process or thing in the real world as class or object

# ---------    class & instances    ---------
# Class
    # bluprient - contains METHODS (functions) and ATTRIBUTES (similar to keys in dict)

# instance
    # objects that are constructed from a class that contains their class's method and properties


# int, list, all those are actually "objects"
    # use "help()" to retrive documentation of Python
        # help() provides all sort of infromation including all "class-methods"
    # for example: "list" is a class and "num = [1, 2, 3]" is a INSTANCE of the 'list-class'




# ------------------    Abstruction & Encapsulation    ------------------
# The goal of OOP is ENCAPSULATE our codes into logocal, hierarchical grouping using classes 
    # it all about ORGANIZING and REUSING our codes
    # get rid of SPAGETTI CODE
